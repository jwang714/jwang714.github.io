	<h2>My Evening Skin Care Routine</h2>
	<img id="cleanse" src="images/IMG_4518.jpg">

	<p>These are some of the skincare products I've been using in the past couple of months. Just for reference, my skin type is normal to dry. Ever since moving to Seattle, my skin has been so dry. I'm used to the humidity in Georgia which I used to hate, but realized is pretty good for my skin after all.
	</p>
	<p><b>TO CLEANSE:</b> I first remove my make-up using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bioderma-Sensibio-H2O-Micelle-Solution/dp/B00D47VIHA">Bioderma</a>. I think I'll always use this because I find it super gentle and really great at removing makeup. I enjoy the consistency of the product as it's feels just like watery and doesn't leave an oily residue on your skin like most make-up removers do. Next, I like to alternate between the <a href="http://andalou.com/index.php/meyer-lemon-creamy-cleanser">Andalou Naturals Meyer Creamy Cleanser</a> and the <a href="http://nourishorganic.com/collections/face/products/moisturizing-face-cleanser">Nourish Organic Moisturizing Cream Face Cleanser</a>. I picked both of these up at my local co-op store. I find the price point really reasonable (around $10-$12 bucks each) and the products are effective at removing any residue! I don't really like to invest heavily in a cleanser because I'd rather spend a lot of money on serums or moisturizer, products where I'm adding nutrients back on to my face versus stripping.<br/><br/>
	<b>TO TREAT:</b> Next, I use <a href="https://www.fresh.com/US/black-tea/black-tea-age-delay-eye-concentrate/H00002861.html">Fresh's Black Tea Age-Delay Eye Concentrate</a>. I bought this on a whim while at Sephora last summer, and so far I like it. However, it is a bit pricey and I don't think I'll be re-purchasing. It is effective at hydrating the eye area, but I think the benefits are minimal considering the high price-point. After, I apply a pea-sized amount of <a href="http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/retinol-treatments/_/Clinical-One-Percent-Retinol-Treatment">Paula's Choice Clinical One Percent Retinol Treatment</a>. Retinol is good product to use if you don't have super sensitive skin, and you're concerned about wrinkles. I use this as a preventive measure for my concerns of skin aging, and loss of elasticity. Lastly, I add a couple drops of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Josie-Maran-Argan-Oil-1-7/dp/B001DJ9JJU">Josie Maran's Aragon Oil</a> into <a href="https://www.origins.com/product/15352/21902/skincare/moisturize/moisturizers/Dr-Andrew-Weil-for-Origins/Mega-Bright-Skin-Illuminating-Moisturizer">Dr. Weil's Mega-Bright Skin Illuminating Moisturizer</a>. I like the Origins moisturizer. However, it is a bit light-weight which is nice in the summers. I need that extra bit of moisture to my skin in the winter months though, so I find the Aragon Oil really helps. You only need a couple drops too! <br/><br/>

	That's my evening skincare routine for now. I try to keep it as simple as possible. Will update when I start using different products!</p><br/><br/>
